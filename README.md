# ChatGPT Test

***still writing more, just pushing so it's not just blank

Testing if ChatGPT prototypes, or if it generates LLM salad.

The goal was to prototype [FlashSwarm](https://github.com/394-s24/FlashSwarm) within an hour of time.

## Process

The initial prompt:
```
You are a web developer with 20 years of experience writing code with react.js.

Your task is to build a fully functional react web app which helps a team schedule meetings spontaneously. For example, if Jeff has a spare 2 hours of time to work with, he can, within 15 seconds, fill out some quick information and click a button to create a "flash swarm".

Assume the most recent version of react.js. The vite project has already been made for you.
```

From here, minor debugging questions were asked to get it to generate something functional. Afterwards, I asked for individual features prompt by prompt.

## Questions
### Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
It works. As in, it's a functional frontend. It's not hooked up to Firebase or any permanent data store, though.
### How is the code better than what the team currently has?
Honestly, it really isn't better. The default times are nice, I suppose. However, for significantly less time invested, it's pretty good.
### How is the code worse?
It doesn't have as many features built out. This is probably just a product of hours.
### How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
Honestly, it was surprisingly seamless, especially given that I've historically struggled a lot with getting ChatGPT to generate coherent code. Most of the time, it ended up doing exactly what I wanted to, barring the one time where it kept spitting out white text on a white background.
### Overall impression of the experience
I would be concerned if I wanted to do frontend in the future long-term. I would probably be out of a job. This is way, way more powerful than my past experiences gave it credit for.
